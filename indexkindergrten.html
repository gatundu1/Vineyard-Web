    <p>
      Vineyard school kindergarten is based on Christian values and is designed to complement individual and group 
      lesson plans, mainly using the Montessori method of teaching and development of the early childhood formative 
      years. We have a team of committed teaching staff that provides a vast array of early years developmental 
      activities and ideas for cross curricular work across the ages of 2 – 6 years.<br>
      The Montessori method is a complete education system that recognizes the crucial importance of a child's first six years of development
     when his/her powers of absorption are highest and lifelong attitudes are formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Montessori system of education was most uniquely designed to encourage the holistic development of the 
      child and to prepare him/her not only for school, but for life.
      The Montessori classroom is a prepared environment which is highly organized and designed to stimulate a 
      child's interest to enable the child to develop to his/her fullest potential as both an intelligent and a 
      responsible social being.

    <b style="font-size: 18px;">PLAY</b><br>
    Play is essential to development because it contributes to the cognitive, physical, social, and emotional 
    well-being of children . Play is important to healthy brain development. It is through play that children at a very early age engage and interact in the world around them
    Play is therefore an integral part of our curriculum.
    Our pupils engage in   Structured play, or "play with a purpose," these are activities that offer preschoolers with 
    specific learning objectives. It could be learning a certain life skill like teaching the months of the year or 
    working on important physical abilities such as gross and fine motor skills.
    Hence our play includes indoor, and out-door play. The outdoor facilities allow for children to swing and slide, 
    and enjoy sand and swimming as well as a myriad sporting activities 
  
    By the time children graduate from the kindergarten, they are  equiped with a  wealth of knowledge .They are able to read and write , do basic arithmetic,read and write in kiwahili,speak  french among other skills. This ensures a smooth transition to the primary school and can fit in whichever curriculum they choose.
